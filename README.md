# Data-cleaning-and-relation-identification

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Student Performance dataset, focusing on uncovering insights into factors affecting studentsâ€™ scores across math, reading, and writing. This analysis serves as part of my ongoing journey in data science, emphasizing statistical exploration, data cleaning, and visualization techniques.

# Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a series of exploratory analyses and statistical methods, including:

-> Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data to prepare for meaningful analysis.
-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated relationships between key features, focusing on:
   -> Gender-based score trends across subjects
   -> Identification of outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
   -> Correlation and covariance analysis to explore dependencies among variables
   
# Key Findings

1. Inter-Subject Correlations: Positive relationships among math, reading, and writing scores indicate that students who perform well in one area tend to excel in others.
2. Gender Insights: On average, males achieved slightly higher math scores, while females tended to score higher in reading and writing.
3. Outliers: Detection of outliers in scores provided insights into unique cases, valuable for understanding broader trends.


# Tools & Libraries

-> Python: Analysis and data manipulation
-> Pandas: Data processing and transformation
-> Seaborn: Visualization of statistical insights


# Next Steps

The findings from this analysis set the foundation for future predictive modeling to understand and potentially forecast student performance trends.
